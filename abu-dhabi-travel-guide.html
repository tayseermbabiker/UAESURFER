            <!-- Why Abu Dhabi Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Abu Dhabi</h2>
                <p>While Dubai grabs headlines with record-breaking skyscrapers, Abu Dhabi quietly perfects the art of sophisticated elegance. As the UAE's capital, this city exudes a confidence that doesn't need to shout - wider boulevards, more green spaces, and a genuine focus on preserving Emirati culture. It's the perfect <strong>day trip from Dubai to Abu Dhabi</strong>, or worth 2-4 days if you want to experience it properly.</p>

                <p>The crown jewel is the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque - one of the world's most beautiful religious buildings, free to visit (just check the <strong>Sheikh Zayed Mosque dress code</strong>: modest clothing, abayas provided for women). Beyond that, you've got the Louvre Abu Dhabi, <strong>Yas Island theme parks</strong> (Ferrari World, Warner Bros, SeaWorld), pristine beaches, and a dining scene that rivals Dubai but feels less frantic.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Day trip tip:</strong> If you only have one day, prioritise Sheikh Zayed Mosque (morning), Louvre Abu Dhabi (afternoon), and Corniche sunset. Skip theme parks for a day trip - they need a full day each.

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Abu Dhabi or Dubai better for my holiday?</summary>
                        <p>Dubai suits travellers who want a fast-paced city break with lots of nightlife and big attractions, while Abu Dhabi is quieter, more relaxed and often feels more "Arabian" and cultural. Many Western visitors choose Dubai for a first UAE trip, then add 1-3 nights in Abu Dhabi or base themselves here for a calmer vibe.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Abu Dhabi safe for tourists and families?</summary>
                        <p>Abu Dhabi is regarded as very safe, with low street crime and a strong focus on family-friendly tourism. Usual big-city common sense is enough. Many hotels, malls, and attractions are designed specifically with children and families in mind.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can tourists drink alcohol in Abu Dhabi?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, tourists over 21 can drink in licensed hotels, bars, restaurants and beach clubs without needing a personal licence. Drinking in public places or being visibly drunk in the street is illegal - keep it inside licensed venues.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is the dress code for Western visitors?</summary>
                        <p>In most tourist areas, modest summer clothes are fine - shoulders and knees covered, especially in malls and public spaces. For Sheikh Zayed Mosque and cultural sites you'll need more coverage, but abayas and headscarves are provided free at entrances.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What's the best way to get around without a car?</summary>
                        <p>Taxis and ride-hailing apps (Uber, Careem) are easiest. There's also a free "Experience Abu Dhabi" shuttle linking major attractions. For day trips to Al Ain or desert areas, most visitors book organised tours rather than public transport.</p>

            <!-- Why Visit Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Abu Dhabi</h2>
                <p>While Dubai grabs headlines with record-breaking skyscrapers, Abu Dhabi quietly perfects the art of sophisticated elegance. As the UAE's capital and home to its federal government, this city exudes a confidence that doesn't need to shout. Here, you'll find wider boulevards, more green spaces, and a deliberate focus on preserving and celebrating Emirati culture alongside modern development.</p>

                <p>The crown jewel is undoubtedly the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque - one of the world's most beautiful religious buildings, where pristine white marble, intricate Islamic art, and stunning architecture create an awe-inspiring experience that transcends faith and culture. But Abu Dhabi's cultural ambitions don't stop there. The Louvre Abu Dhabi represents a bridge between Eastern and Western art, while the upcoming Guggenheim promises to further cement the city's status as a global cultural capital.</p>

                <p>Beyond museums and monuments, Abu Dhabi offers extraordinary diversity. Yas Island has become a world-class entertainment hub with Formula 1 racing, Ferrari World, Warner Bros. theme park, SeaWorld Abu Dhabi (opened in 2023 as the region's first marine-life theme park), and pristine beaches. New in 2024-2025, TeamLab Phenomena Abu Dhabi brings mesmerizing immersive digital art experiences to Saadiyat Cultural District. Nature lovers will discover the Butterfly Reserve at Umm Qurqum, a unique conservation project showcasing native species. The Corniche waterfront provides 8 kilometers of pristine beach, parks, and cycling paths - all free to enjoy. Meanwhile, traditional souks, heritage villages, and falcon hospitals keep you connected to authentic Emirati traditions.</p>

                <p>What sets Abu Dhabi apart is its pace. This is a city that moves with purpose but never feels frantic. Streets are cleaner, traffic is lighter, and there's a genuine sense of space to breathe. For families, the mix of educational attractions, theme parks, and safe beaches makes it ideal. For culture seekers, the museums and architecture rival world capitals. And for those seeking luxury, Abu Dhabi's hotels and dining scene deliver opulence with understated refinement that feels authentically Arabian rather than merely imported.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Getting Around Abu Dhabi</h2>
                <p><strong>From Dubai:</strong> Most visitors arrive from Dubai (150km, 1.5 hours). Options include car rental (AED 100-150/day), bus service (E101/E102, AED 25, hourly), or taxi/Uber (AED 250-350 one way).</p>

                <p><strong>Within Abu Dhabi:</strong> Taxis and ride-sharing (Uber, Careem) are most convenient. Abu Dhabi bus network covers major routes but less tourist-friendly than Dubai Metro. Expect AED 25-40 for most taxi trips within city.</p>

                <p><strong>Yas Island Transportation:</strong> Free shuttle buses connect Yas Island hotels with theme parks. Alternatively, 10-15 minute walk between attractions. Taxis from downtown Abu Dhabi to Yas Island cost AED 60-80.</p>

                <p><strong>Money-saving tip:</strong> Rent a car if visiting for 2+ days and planning Al Ain day trip. Parking is free at most attractions and malls. Driver's license from most countries accepted for tourists.</p>

                <p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> November-March offers ideal weather (20-28°C). Summer (June-September) is extremely hot (40-45°C) but theme parks and museums are indoor. Hotel rates drop 30-40% in summer.</p>

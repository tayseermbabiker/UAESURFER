            <!-- Why Ajman Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Ajman</h2>
                <p>If you're wondering "<strong>Ajman vs Dubai for a quiet beach</strong>" - Ajman wins every time. This is the UAE's smallest emirate, and that's exactly its appeal. No mega-malls, no record-breaking towers, just peaceful beaches, a relaxed corniche, and prices that make your wallet happy. <strong>Is Ajman cheaper than Dubai?</strong> Yes - hotels here cost 30-50% less than equivalent Dubai properties.</p>

                <p>Ajman works perfectly as a <strong>day trip from Dubai</strong> (30-45 mins drive) or as a budget-friendly base for exploring the northern emirates. The corniche has that "small resort town" vibe that Dubai lost years ago - local families on the beach, fishermen bringing in catches, sunset walks without fighting for space. If you want authentic Gulf coast without the tourist infrastructure, this is it.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Budget tip:</strong> Stay in Ajman, day-trip to Dubai. You'll save 30-50% on accommodation while being close enough to see everything. Many expats do exactly this.

                        <strong>It's genuinely cheaper</strong>
                        <p>Not marketing speak - Ajman hotels really are 30-50% less than Dubai. Same beach, same Gulf, fraction of the price.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <strong>Alcohol is available</strong>
                        <p>Unlike Sharjah, Ajman has licensed hotels and bars. You can have a beer with your beach sunset.</p>

                        <p>Stay here, day-trip there. You get the best of both: quiet nights, Dubai days. Many expats live this way.</p>

                        <p>Corniche fills with Emirati families on Friday evenings. It's lovely to see - the beach as it should be.</p>

                        <strong>Fish market is legit</strong>
                        <p>Early morning fish market is real local life. Buy fish, have a nearby restaurant cook it for 20-30 AED. Classic Gulf experience.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Why would I stay in Ajman instead of Dubai?</summary>
                        <p>Ajman offers quieter beaches, smaller resorts and lower prices, while still being 30-45 minutes by car from Dubai. It suits travellers who want a relaxed base and are happy to day-trip into Dubai or Sharjah for attractions.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Ajman cheaper than Dubai?</summary>
                        <p>Yes. Beachfront hotels and everyday dining in Ajman cost noticeably less than equivalent Dubai options. Western visitors often choose Ajman for better value on all-inclusive or half-board beach stays.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can tourists drink alcohol in Ajman?</summary>
                        <p>Yes - Ajman is one of the more relaxed emirates. Non-Muslim adults can drink in licensed hotels, bars and some shops without a personal licence. Public drinking and visible drunkenness is still illegal.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is the dress code in Ajman?</summary>
                        <p>Similar to other emirates: cover shoulders and knees in malls, markets and public areas. Swimwear is fine on hotel beaches and pools but not for walking around town or shopping.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can I day trip to Ajman from Dubai?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely - many visitors do exactly this. The drive from Dubai is under an hour outside rush hour, making Ajman easy to add to a wider UAE itinerary for a beach day, museum visit, or evening on the Corniche.</p>

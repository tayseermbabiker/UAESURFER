            <!-- Why Visit Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Ajman</h2>
                <p>Ajman is the antidote to Dubai's relentless energy. This is the UAE in slow motion - where local fishermen still mend nets on the beach, traditional dhows are built by hand using centuries-old techniques, and the corniche remains blissfully free of mega-developments. At just 259 square kilometers, it's the smallest emirate with a GDP of AED 36 billion, but this compact size means everything is walkable and genuinely accessible.</p>

                <p>The beaches here offer something increasingly rare in the UAE: space and tranquility. Ajman Corniche stretches for kilometers with clean sand, gentle waves, and families enjoying simple pleasures without the resort infrastructure that dominates other coastlines. Budget-conscious travelers discover that Ajman's hotels cost 40-50% less than equivalent Dubai properties while offering the same Arabian Gulf beach access. The Ajman Palace Hotel (which achieved prestigious 7-star rating status in 2025) and Fairmont provide genuine luxury at mid-range prices.</p>

                <p>What makes Ajman special is its authentic local character. The National Museum housed in an 18th-century fort tells the emirate's pearl diving and maritime history through well-curated exhibits. The dhow building yards remain active, where craftsmen construct traditional wooden boats using techniques passed down through generations. The fish market offers a glimpse into daily Emirati life that's increasingly rare as the UAE modernizes. For travelers seeking genuine Arabian Gulf culture without tourist gloss, Ajman delivers authenticity that larger emirates have traded away.</p>

            <!-- Top Experiences Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Top Ajman Experiences</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Discover peaceful beaches, authentic heritage sites, and budget-friendly local experiences</p>

                <h3>1. Ajman Corniche & Public Beach</h3>
                <p><strong>⭐ Free Access | Half Day - Full Day</strong></p>
                <p>Ajman's beautiful corniche stretches for several kilometers along pristine beaches with clean sand and gentle waves. Unlike Dubai's resort-dominated coastline, this remains wonderfully accessible and uncrowded. The wide promenade is perfect for walking, jogging, and cycling, with local families enjoying picnics and beach time throughout the day. Palm trees provide natural shade, and the beach itself is well-maintained with minimal commercial development.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Visit during sunset for spectacular views across the Arabian Gulf. The corniche has free public parking and is never crowded like Dubai's beaches. Local cafes along the corniche serve refreshments at very reasonable prices. Weekend evenings see families gathering for beach barbecues.</p>

                <h3>2. Ajman National Museum</h3>
                <p><strong>Entry: AED 10 | Duration: 1-2 hours</strong></p>
                <p>Housed in an impressive 18th-century fort that once served as the ruler's residence, this well-curated museum tells Ajman's story from pearl diving to modern development. Exhibits include traditional weapons, archaeological finds, manuscripts, a recreated traditional souk, and displays about pearl diving that was once the region's economic lifeblood. The fort's architecture alone is worth the visit, with traditional wind towers and defensive structures beautifully preserved.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> At just AED 10, it's exceptional value. Visit midday when it's too hot for beach activities. The museum offers air-conditioned respite and excellent photo opportunities. English descriptions are comprehensive. Allow extra time to explore the fort's architecture and courtyard.</p>

                <h3>3. Al Zorah Natural Reserve & Mangroves</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Walking | 2-3 hours | Kayaking: AED 150+</strong></p>
                <p>This protected 2 square kilometer reserve preserves Ajman's natural mangrove ecosystem, lagoons, and wildlife habitat. Over 60 species of birds including herons, flamingos, and kingfishers inhabit the area. Walking trails wind through the reserve with viewing platforms for birdwatching and photography. The adjacent Al Zorah Golf Club creates a scenic backdrop. Kayaking tours through the mangroves offer closer wildlife encounters in the peaceful waterways.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Early morning (6-8am) is best for birdwatching when wildlife is most active. The walking trails are free and well-maintained. Bring binoculars and water. Kayaking tours require booking in advance - contact local operators. Sunset kayaking offers magical lighting for photography.</p>

                <h3>4. Traditional Dhow Building Yards</h3>
                <p><strong>⭐ Free Viewing | 1 hour</strong></p>
                <p>Ajman preserves one of the Gulf's last active traditional dhow building yards where master craftsmen continue constructing wooden boats using centuries-old techniques passed down through generations. Watch skilled builders shape hulls from imported teak using hand tools, traditional measuring methods, and time-honored joinery. These working boats - not tourist replicas - are still commissioned by buyers across the Gulf for fishing and cargo transport.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Visit weekday mornings (7-11am) when work is most active. The yards are near the fish market and corniche - easy to combine. Ask permission before photographing workers. Most craftsmen are friendly and may explain their work if you show genuine interest. This living heritage is increasingly rare in the modernized UAE.</p>

                <h3>5. Masfout Mountain Area</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Exploration | Half Day Trip</strong></p>
                <p>Masfout is Ajman's mountain enclave located 110km inland, surrounded by Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah territory. This remote area offers dramatic mountain scenery, traditional villages, date palm plantations, and rugged hiking trails. The drive itself is spectacular as you climb from coastal plains into the Hajar Mountains. Ancient aflaj irrigation systems still water the terraced farms. It's a complete contrast to coastal Ajman and sees very few tourists.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Rent a 4WD for the mountain roads. Bring water and snacks as there are limited facilities. Best visited October-March when temperatures are cooler. Combine with nearby Hatta or Fujairah visits. Respect that this is a working agricultural area - don't enter private farms without permission.</p>

                <h3>6. Ajman Gold Souq</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Browsing | 1-2 hours</strong></p>
                <p>While smaller than Dubai's famous Gold Souq, Ajman's gold market offers better prices and a more authentic, pressure-free shopping experience. Local goldsmiths craft traditional and contemporary designs with gold priced by weight plus modest making charges. The souq atmosphere is relaxed - shop owners are friendly without the aggressive salesmanship found in tourist-heavy markets. Many Emiratis shop here for wedding jewelry and gold gifts.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Gold prices are standardized by weight, but making charges are negotiable. Visit multiple shops to compare designs and craftsmanship. Serious buyers should check daily gold rates before shopping. Evenings (6-9pm) are busiest when locals shop. The souq also sells traditional perfumes and textiles at good prices.</p>

                <h3>7. Ajman Fish Market</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Exploration | 1 hour</strong></p>
                <p>The bustling fish market offers an authentic glimpse into daily Emirati life that's increasingly rare in the UAE. Every morning (5-9am), local fishermen sell their fresh catches - kingfish, hammour, shrimp, crab, and more. The market operates in a modern building but maintains traditional trading atmosphere. Buy ultra-fresh seafood at local prices, then have nearby restaurants cook it for you - a classic Gulf dining experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Visit by 7am for best selection when catches are freshest. Prices are negotiable. Bring small bills as vendors often lack change. Several small restaurants near the market will cook your purchased fish for AED 20-30. The market is near the dhow yards - combine both visits.</p>

                <h3>8. Sheikh Zayed Ajman Mosque</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Entry (Respectful Dress Required) | 30 minutes</strong></p>
                <p>This beautiful modern mosque welcomes non-Muslim visitors outside prayer times. The architecture blends traditional Islamic design with contemporary elements, featuring intricate geometric patterns, elegant domes, and peaceful courtyard gardens. It's smaller and far less crowded than Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, offering a more intimate cultural experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Respectful dress is required (covered shoulders, long pants/skirts). Women should bring a headscarf. Visit between prayer times - check prayer schedules before going. The mosque is beautifully lit at night for photography. Fridays are busiest with congregational prayers.</p>

                <h3>9. Ajman City Center & Shopping</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Browsing | 2-3 hours</strong></p>
                <p>While lacking Dubai's mega-malls, Ajman City Center and local souqs offer authentic shopping without tourist inflation. The small malls have standard international brands at UAE prices, while traditional markets sell spices, textiles, household goods, and daily necessities. It's shopping as locals do it, not as a tourist attraction. Prices are notably lower than Dubai for comparable items.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Traditional souqs near the fish market offer better value and atmosphere than malls. Bargaining is expected in souqs but not in modern stores. The China Mall area has incredibly cheap household goods and electronics. Combine shopping with corniche walks and local dining for an authentic day.</p>

                <h3>10. Beach Resorts & Water Sports</h3>
                <p><strong>Day Passes: From AED 100+ | Water Sports: AED 150+</strong></p>
                <p>Several beach resorts offer day passes including beach access, pools, and facilities at prices 40-50% lower than Dubai equivalents. The Ajman Palace Hotel (7-star rated in 2025) and Fairmont provide luxury beach club experiences at mid-range prices. Water sports including jet skiing, parasailing, banana boat rides, and kayaking are available at affordable rates through beach operators and hotels.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Weekday day passes are significantly cheaper than weekends. Book directly with hotels rather than aggregators for better rates. The public corniche beach is free and just as beautiful if you don't need resort amenities. Water sports prices are negotiable, especially for multiple activities.</p>

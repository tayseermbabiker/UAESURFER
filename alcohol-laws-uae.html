            <!-- Section 1: Where Alcohol Is Legal -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>✅ Where You Can Legally Drink</h2>
                <p>The UAE has a clear framework for alcohol consumption. As a tourist, you can enjoy alcoholic beverages in designated licensed venues without any special permits.</p>

                <h3>Licensed Venues (100% Legal for Tourists)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hotel bars & restaurants:</strong> Any hotel with 3+ stars typically has license. Most popular option for tourists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Licensed restaurants:</strong> Standalone restaurants with alcohol license (usually upscale dining establishments)</li>
                    <li><strong>Nightclubs:</strong> All nightclubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and other emirates are licensed venues</li>
                    <li><strong>Beach clubs:</strong> Private beach clubs attached to hotels can serve alcohol</li>
                    <li><strong>Golf clubs:</strong> Most golf clubs have licensed bars and restaurants</li>
                    <li><strong>Airport duty-free:</strong> Can purchase and consume alcohol in airport lounges and duty-free areas</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Popular Areas with Many Licensed Venues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dubai Marina:</strong> Dozens of restaurants and bars along the waterfront</li>
                    <li><strong>JBR (Jumeirah Beach Residence):</strong> Beach clubs and restaurants with licenses</li>

                    <li><strong>Abu Dhabi - Yas Island:</strong> Hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues</li>
                    <li><strong>Fujairah:</strong> More relaxed atmosphere, many licensed venues</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Hotel bars often have happy hour deals from 5-8 PM with 50% off drinks. Brands like JW Marriott, Hilton, and Radisson consistently offer good value and atmosphere.
                </div>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>2025 Pricing Update:</strong> Dubai reinstated a 30% alcohol tax in January 2025, significantly increasing prices at bars, restaurants, and shops. Expect to pay more than in previous years. Abu Dhabi and other emirates may have different tax rates.

            <!-- Section 2: Where Alcohol Is NOT Allowed -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Where You Cannot Drink</h2>
                <p>Understanding where alcohol is prohibited helps you avoid serious legal troubles. The rules apply equally to tourists and residents.</p>

                <h3>Strictly Prohibited Locations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Public beaches:</strong> Even tourist beaches like JBR - no alcohol unless you're inside a licensed beach club</li>
                    <li><strong>Parks and public spaces:</strong> All public parks, gardens, and recreational areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Streets and sidewalks:</strong> Never walk down the street with open container</li>

                    <li><strong>Shopping malls:</strong> Except licensed restaurants within the mall</li>
                    <li><strong>Your car:</strong> Even if parked and not driving, open containers in car are illegal</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharjah emirate:</strong> Completely dry emirate - NO alcohol anywhere, even in hotels</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ramadan Restrictions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>During Ramadan (Islamic holy month), alcohol service may be restricted during daylight hours</li>
                    <li>Most hotel bars close during the day, open after sunset</li>
                    <li>Some venues don't serve alcohol at all during Ramadan</li>
                    <li>Always check ahead if visiting during Ramadan (dates change yearly)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Critical Warning:</strong> Being drunk in public is a criminal offense, even if you drank legally in a licensed venue. If you're visibly intoxicated outside the venue, you can be arrested. Stay in control of yourself at all times.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 3: Purchasing Alcohol -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Buying Alcohol to Take Home</h2>
                <p>The rules for purchasing alcohol to consume at home (or hotel room) are more complex than just drinking in venues.</p>

                <h3>For Tourists</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimum age 21:</strong> Strictly enforced at all venues and duty-free. Must show passport or Emirates ID</li>
                    <li><strong>Airport duty-free:</strong> Best option for tourists. Can buy upon arrival or departure (recommended: buy on arrival)</li>
                    <li><strong>Limits at duty-free:</strong> 4 liters of spirits OR 2 cartons of beer (48 cans) per person</li>
                    <li><strong>Consume in private:</strong> You can drink purchased alcohol in your hotel room or private accommodation</li>
                    <li><strong>No license needed:</strong> Tourists don't need alcohol license for duty-free purchases</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotel delivery (NEW 2025):</strong> Licensed delivery services can now deliver alcohol to your hotel room through authorized providers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Liquor Stores (Primarily for Residents)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>License no longer required (2022 reform):</strong> Tourists can purchase from licensed stores like African + Eastern and MMI without a license</li>
                    <li><strong>Age 21 enforced:</strong> Must show valid ID proving you're 21 or older</li>
                    <li><strong>E-commerce options (NEW 2025):</strong> Online ordering and delivery now legal through licensed platforms, but delivery must be to authorized locations (hotels, private residences)</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Duty-free still offers best prices, but stores are convenient if you need more during your stay</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Resident Alcohol License (FYI)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>UAE residents can apply for alcohol license (AED 270 per year)</li>
                    <li>Allows purchasing from liquor stores like African + Eastern, MMI</li>
                    <li>Not really relevant for tourists on short stays</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>💡 Money Saving Tip:</strong> Duty-free alcohol is significantly cheaper than hotel bars. A bottle that costs AED 80 at duty-free might be AED 60+ per glass in a bar. If you plan to drink in your room, stock up on arrival.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 4: Drunk in Public Laws -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Being Drunk in Public</h2>
                <p>This is where many tourists get into trouble. You can drink legally, but being visibly intoxicated in public spaces is a criminal offense.</p>

                <h3>What "Drunk in Public" Means</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visible intoxication:</strong> Stumbling, slurred speech, aggressive behavior, vomiting</li>
                    <li><strong>Outside licensed venues:</strong> Once you leave the bar/restaurant, you're in "public"</li>
                    <li><strong>In your hotel lobby:</strong> Even hotel common areas count as public</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting to/from taxi:</strong> Brief walk from venue to taxi should be fine if you're composed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Potential Consequences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Police warning:</strong> If cooperative and not causing trouble</li>
                    <li><strong>Fine:</strong> AED 2,000-5,000 for public intoxication</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrest and detention:</strong> If aggressive, combative, or causing disturbance</li>
                    <li><strong>Deportation:</strong> In serious cases or if you have prior violations</li>
                    <li><strong>Criminal record:</strong> Can affect future UAE travel and other countries</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Real-World Application</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having 2-3 drinks at dinner = perfectly fine</li>
                    <li>Walking steadily to taxi after drinks = fine</li>
                    <li>Getting loud and stumbling in hotel lobby = potential problem</li>
                    <li>Vomiting on street or being aggressive = definite problem</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> If someone reports you (hotel staff, security, other guests), police will respond. UAE takes public intoxication very seriously as part of maintaining public order and respecting local culture.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 5: Drunk Driving -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Drunk Driving - Zero Tolerance</h2>
                <p>The UAE has one of the strictest drunk driving policies in the world. Unlike Western countries, there's no "safe limit" - ANY alcohol in your blood while driving is illegal.</p>

                <h3>The Law</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero tolerance:</strong> 0.00% blood alcohol limit (not 0.08% like US/UK)</li>
                    <li><strong>Any amount = criminal offense:</strong> Even one beer hours ago can result in arrest</li>
                    <li><strong>Morning after:</strong> Alcohol from previous night can still be in your blood - you can still be arrested</li>
                    <li><strong>Police checkpoints:</strong> Random breathalyzer checks are common, especially weekends and holidays</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Penalties for Drunk Driving</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First offense:</strong> AED 20,000-30,000 fine + license suspension + possible jail time (1-3 months)</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle confiscation:</strong> Car can be impounded for 60+ days</li>
                    <li><strong>Criminal record:</strong> Permanent record affecting future travel</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance issues:</strong> Accident while drunk = insurance won't cover, you pay all damages</li>
                    <li><strong>Deportation:</strong> For expats and can affect tourist visa future applications</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Safe Alternatives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use taxis:</strong> Inexpensive and abundant (AED 30-80 for most trips)</li>
                    <li><strong>Uber/Careem:</strong> Ride apps work perfectly and prices are reasonable</li>
                    <li><strong>Hotel stay:</strong> If drinking, consider staying at that hotel for the night</li>
                    <li><strong>Designated driver services:</strong> Services that drive you home in YOUR car</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <strong>Critical - Don't Risk It:</strong> Taxis are cheap. Uber is everywhere. The penalties for drunk driving can ruin your trip and create lifelong consequences. It's simply not worth the risk in a zero-tolerance country.
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 6: Cultural Context -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Cultural Context & Respect</h2>
                <p>Understanding WHY these laws exist helps you navigate them respectfully and avoid unintentional offense.</p>

                <h3>Islamic Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Islam prohibits alcohol consumption - this is fundamental to Emirati culture</li>
                    <li>UAE allows alcohol for non-Muslims as part of tourism and expatriate accommodation</li>
                    <li>The compromise: alcohol permitted in private/designated venues, but not in public view</li>
                    <li>This shows respect for local values while accommodating international visitors</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Respectful Behavior</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discretion:</strong> Don't flaunt alcohol consumption in view of locals who may find it offensive</li>
                    <li><strong>Quiet in residential areas:</strong> Late-night noise from drinking is not tolerated</li>
                    <li><strong>Dress appropriately:</strong> Even in bars, avoid extremely revealing clothing</li>
                    <li><strong>No PDA when drunk:</strong> Public displays of affection are frowned upon, worse when drinking</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Balance</h3>
                <p>The UAE has found a balance between being an international tourism/business hub and maintaining Islamic cultural values. As a visitor, respecting this balance ensures everyone can coexist comfortably. The rules aren't meant to restrict enjoyment - they're meant to maintain harmony between different cultures and values.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Cultural Insight:</strong> Many Emiratis appreciate that visitors respect local customs. Simple awareness and discretion go a long way. You'll find UAE to be incredibly welcoming when mutual respect is shown.

                <h3>Can I drink alcohol during Ramadan?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but with restrictions. Most hotel bars and licensed venues are closed during daylight hours (sunrise to sunset) out of respect. They open after Iftar (breaking fast). Some venues don't serve alcohol at all during Ramadan. Always call ahead to confirm. Being drunk in public during Ramadan is taken even more seriously than usual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the legal drinking age in UAE?</h3>
                <p>21 years old across all emirates. ID will be checked at licensed venues, and it's strictly enforced. If you're providing alcohol to someone under 21, you can face serious penalties including jail time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I bring alcohol into UAE in my checked luggage?</h3>
                <p>No, customs regulations prohibit importing alcohol except through official duty-free at the airport. Attempting to bring alcohol in your luggage can result in confiscation and fines. Duty-free upon arrival is the legal way to bring alcohol into the country.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is there any emirate where alcohol is completely banned?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Sharjah is a dry emirate - no alcohol is available anywhere, including hotels. Many people visit Dubai or Ajman (neighboring emirates) if they want to drink while based in Sharjah. Umm Al Quwain also has very limited alcohol availability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I order alcohol delivery to my hotel room?</h3>
                <p>Yes, most hotels offer room service with alcohol menu. You can order drinks to your room just like food. This is perfectly legal. Some delivery apps also offer alcohol delivery to hotels and private residences (license may be required for delivery apps).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I get into an accident after drinking (not driving)?</h3>
                <p>If you're a passenger or pedestrian and alcohol is detected in your system during an accident investigation, you could still face charges if authorities determine intoxication contributed to the incident. It's complex, but being sober always keeps you legally safer.</p>

                <h2>Is Dubai worth visiting?</h2>
                <p>Dubai is absolutely worth visiting. It offers a unique blend of ultramodern architecture like the Burj Khalifa, world-class shopping at Dubai Mall, stunning beaches, thrilling desert safaris, and an incredible international food scene. Most first-time visitors need 3-4 days to cover the highlights. The best time to visit is November to March when the weather is pleasant.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Dubai</h2>
                <p>Dubai is the easiest introduction to the Middle East - safe, modern, and endlessly surprising. In one city you'll find the world's tallest building, authentic Arabian souks, pristine beaches, and desert adventures just 45 minutes away. It's a city that genuinely caters to everyone, whether you're traveling solo, as a couple, or with family.</p>

                <p>For first-time visitors, <strong>things to do in Dubai</strong> range from free experiences (public beaches, heritage walks, mosque visits) to bucket-list splurges (helicopter tours, underwater dining, desert glamping). The city just opened <strong>Therme Dubai</strong> in January 2025 - one of the world's largest wellness destinations - and a Disney theme park is confirmed for the coming years.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>First timer tip:</strong> Don't try to see everything. Pick 2-3 experiences per day maximum. The heat, distances, and sensory overload will tire you out faster than you expect.
                </div>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Local Tip:</strong> Skip the Burj Khalifa observation deck during sunset as prices triple. Instead, get sunset views for free from Dubai Frame or the Rixos rooftop bar at JBR. The photos are just as impressive.

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Dubai really as expensive as people say?</summary>
                        <p>Dubai can be pricey if you choose only five-star hotels and fine dining, but budget and mid-range trips are very possible with planning. Daily costs can be similar to London or other major European cities if you use public transport, local eateries, and a mix of free/cheap attractions.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What are the most important do's and don'ts for Western visitors?</summary>
                        <p><strong>Do:</strong> Dress modestly in public (cover shoulders and knees), use licensed venues for alcohol, be respectful during Ramadan and in mosques. <strong>Don't:</strong> Get visibly drunk in public, show excessive public displays of affection, behave aggressively, or criticise local authorities online or offline.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Dubai or Abu Dhabi better for a short trip?</summary>
                        <p>Dubai is better for first-time UAE visitors - more attractions, easier to navigate, better nightlife. Abu Dhabi is calmer, more cultural (Sheikh Zayed Mosque, Louvre), and great as a day trip from Dubai (90 mins drive). Most visitors do 3-4 days Dubai + 1 day Abu Dhabi.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is a desert safari in Dubai worth it?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, a Dubai desert safari is a must-do experience. The best desert safaris include dune bashing, camel rides, BBQ dinner, and traditional entertainment. Book a morning safari to avoid crowds, or sunset safari for the best photos. Budget around $50-80 per person.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Dubai safe for tourists?</summary>
                        <p>Extremely safe. Dubai has one of the world's lowest crime rates. Women can travel solo comfortably, streets are safe at night. Just follow local laws (modest dress in public areas, respectful behaviour).</p>

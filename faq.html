                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While travel insurance is not mandatory for most visitors to Dubai, it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> for covering medical emergencies, trip cancellations, and lost luggage. Healthcare in the UAE is world-class but expensive for uninsured tourists. Many countries and travel experts recommend comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical expenses up to $50,000, emergency evacuation, and COVID-related cancellations when visiting the UAE.</p>

                        <p>No special vaccinations are required for most travelers visiting Dubai and UAE from North America, Europe, or Australia. However, routine vaccinations like Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Typhoid are recommended by health authorities. If you're traveling from countries with yellow fever transmission, you must present a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate. It's advisable to consult your doctor 4-6 weeks before travel for personalized health advice.</p>

                        <p>Yes, tourist visas can be extended in Dubai through the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) or authorized travel agencies. Extensions are typically granted for 30 days at a time, and you can apply before your current visa expires. The process requires your passport, current visa copy, passport photos, and payment of extension fees (600 AED plus 5% VAT). It's recommended to apply at least one week before your visa expiration date. Note that the 10-day grace period has been removed and overstaying incurs a fine of 50 AED per day.</p>

Prescription medications should be accompanied by a doctor's prescription and should not exceed a 3-month supply.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dubai offers excellent public transportation including the <strong>Dubai Metro</strong> (Red and Green lines covering major attractions), modern air-conditioned buses, water taxis (abras), and the Dubai Tram in Dubai Marina.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>For short visits (3-5 days) focused on Dubai city, <strong>taxis and ride-sharing apps are more convenient</strong> due to traffic, parking challenges, and excellent taxi availability. However, if you're planning to explore multiple emirates, visit remote desert areas, or staying longer than a week, renting a car offers more freedom and can be cost-effective. Dubai has modern highways, clear signage in English, and affordable fuel prices. International driving permits are accepted for tourists from most countries.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A taxi from Dubai International Airport (DXB) to Downtown Dubai typically costs <strong>60-80 AED (approximately $16-22 USD)</strong> and takes 15-20 minutes depending on traffic. Airport taxis have a starting fare of 25 AED compared to 12 AED for regular taxis. For Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), expect to pay 120-150 AED to reach Downtown Dubai as it's located farther south. Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem offer similar rates and can be pre-booked.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, Dubai has Uber and Careem (now owned by Uber), both of which are legal, regulated, and widely used throughout the UAE. These apps offer competitive rates compared to regular taxis and provide convenience of cashless payment and ride tracking. Careem is particularly popular locally and sometimes offers better pricing during peak hours. Both services operate 24/7 and are available at airports, hotels, and throughout the city with typical wait times of 3-5 minutes.</p>

                        <p>Dubai is relatively liberal, but visitors should dress modestly in public areas. <strong>In malls, restaurants, and streets</strong>, cover shoulders and knees (avoid tank tops, short shorts, or mini skirts). Swimwear is appropriate at beaches and pools but cover up when leaving these areas. At mosques and religious sites, women must cover hair, arms, and legs; men should wear long pants. Loose, breathable fabrics work best in Dubai's hot climate. Hotels, beach clubs, and tourist areas are more relaxed with dress codes.</p>

                        <p>Yes, <strong>unmarried couples can legally share hotel rooms in Dubai</strong> since reforms in 2020. The UAE decriminalized cohabitation for unmarried couples, making it officially permissible for tourists and residents. Hotels will not ask for marriage certificates when checking in. However, public displays of affection should still be minimal and respectful of local customs. Same-sex couples should be aware that while hotels generally accept bookings, public displays of affection remain sensitive in this conservative region.</p>

                        <p>Alcohol is legal and available in Dubai at <strong>licensed hotels, restaurants, and bars</strong> but not in regular shops (except specialized liquor stores requiring a license). Tourists can drink at hotel bars, beach clubs, and licensed restaurants throughout Dubai. Drinking in public places or streets is illegal and can result in fines or arrest. The legal drinking age is 21. Alcohol can be consumed in hotel rooms. Check our <a href="index.html#essentials">alcohol laws guide</a> for complete information and cultural sensitivities.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>During Ramadan (dates vary annually based on lunar calendar), Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. Tourists should <strong>avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public</strong> during daylight hours out of respect. Most restaurants remain closed until sunset (Iftar) but many hotels serve food to tourists in designated areas. Shopping malls and attractions operate with reduced hours. Many hotels offer special Iftar buffets providing a unique cultural experience. Nightlife is vibrant after sunset, and it's an excellent time to experience Emirati hospitality and traditions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dubai boasts world-class rooftop dining including <strong>At.mosphere</strong> in Burj Khalifa (world's highest restaurant), CÉ LA VI with stunning skyline views, Maiden Shanghai at Pier 7 in Dubai Marina, and Tomo at Raffles Hotel. For unique experiences, try Pierchic (overwater seafood restaurant), Dinner in the Sky (suspended dining), or desert dining with Platinum Heritage.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p><strong>Dubai Mall</strong> is the largest and most popular, offering 1,200+ stores, Dubai Aquarium, ice rink, and entertainment options. Mall of the Emirates features Ski Dubai and luxury shopping. For budget shopping, visit Deira City Centre or Dragon Mart (Chinese wholesale market). Gold Souk in Deira offers the best gold prices, while traditional souks provide authentic Middle Eastern shopping experiences. Dubai Shopping Festival (January-February) and Dubai Summer Surprises (July-August) offer significant discounts and promotions across all malls.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory in Dubai. Most restaurants add a <strong>10% service charge</strong> to bills, but additional tips of 10-15% for excellent service are welcome. For taxis, rounding up to the nearest 5-10 AED is common. Hotel porters expect 5-10 AED per bag, and housekeeping appreciates 10-20 AED per day. At spas and salons, 15-20% tip is standard. Small tips for exceptional service are always appreciated and show gratitude for hospitality in Emirati culture.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, <strong>over 95% of restaurants in Dubai serve halal food</strong> as it's standard in the UAE. Most international chains modify their menus to serve halal meat. Pork is only available in licensed hotels and restaurants serving alcohol, and will be clearly marked on menus. Vegetarian and vegan options are increasingly common across Dubai's diverse dining scene. Restaurants specify "halal" or "non-halal" (usually meaning pork or non-halal meat) on their signage and menus, making it easy for Muslim travelers to dine confidently.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The UAE Dirham (AED or DHS) is the official currency, pegged to the US Dollar at approximately <strong>3.67 AED = 1 USD</strong>. Currency exchange is available at airports, banks, hotels, and licensed exchange houses (Al Ansari Exchange, UAE Exchange) throughout the city. Exchange houses typically offer better rates than hotels or airports. ATMs are widely available and accept international cards. Credit cards are accepted everywhere, and contactless payment is common. Carry small amounts of cash for taxis, souks, and small vendors.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dubai can range from <strong>moderate to luxury-expensive</strong> depending on choices. Budget travelers can manage on $75-100 per day with budget hotels, public transport, and casual dining. Mid-range visitors typically spend $150-300 per day for 4-star hotels, taxis, and quality restaurants. Luxury experiences (5-star hotels, fine dining, premium activities) can exceed $500+ per day. Compared to European or US cities, Dubai offers excellent value for luxury services, while budget options may be pricier than Southeast Asia. Shopping and entertainment are competitive with global prices.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dubai uses <strong>Type G (UK-style three-pin) plugs</strong> with 220-240V electrical outlets. If you're traveling from North America, you'll need both a plug adapter and potentially a voltage converter for devices not rated for 220V. Most modern electronics (phones, laptops, cameras) have dual voltage (110-240V) and only require a plug adapter. Type D (Indian-style) sockets are also common. Universal travel adapters work well and can be purchased at Dubai Airport or any electronics store.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Dubai is considered <strong>very safe for solo female travelers</strong> with low crime rates and strong law enforcement. Women can travel alone, take taxis at night, and explore attractions independently with confidence. Dress modestly (covering shoulders and knees) in public areas, and you'll experience respectful treatment. Female-only taxi services and dedicated women's sections on public transport provide extra comfort. As with any destination, use common sense: avoid isolated areas late at night, don't accept drinks from strangers, and stay aware of surroundings in crowded places.</p>

                        <p>Arabic is the official language, but <strong>English is widely spoken</strong> and understood throughout Dubai, especially in tourism, business, and service sectors. Signs, menus, and public transport announcements are in both Arabic and English. With over 200 nationalities residing in Dubai, you'll also hear Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, and many other languages. International visitors rarely face language barriers in hotels, restaurants, attractions, or when using taxis. Learning a few basic Arabic phrases like "Shukran" (thank you) and "Marhaba" (hello) is appreciated and shows cultural respect.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Fujairah</h2>
                <p>Fujairah is the UAE's only emirate on the Gulf of Oman - and that makes all the difference. The water here is clearer, calmer, and actually good for <strong>snorkeling in Fujairah</strong>. While Dubai's Arabian Gulf beaches are murky, Fujairah's east coast offers genuine coral reefs, marine life, and dive sites that attract serious divers. It's the perfect <strong>day trip from Dubai</strong> for anyone wanting to actually see fish.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Dubai to Fujairah drive</strong> is half the experience - 1.5-2 hours through dramatic Hajar Mountain passes, wadi valleys, and the famous Friday Market at Masafi. <strong>Best beach resorts in Fujairah</strong> like Le Meridien Al Aqah and Fairmont Fujairah offer beachfront luxury at prices below Dubai equivalents, with actual snorkeling off the beach. This feels like a different country from Dubai - mountains meeting sea, no skyscrapers, genuine nature.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Weekend tip:</strong> Many Dubai residents do Fujairah as a weekend escape. Leave Friday morning, enjoy the mountain drive, snorkel Saturday, return Sunday. It's the closest "real beach" to Dubai.

                        <strong>The drive is half the fun</strong>
                        <p>Dubai to Fujairah by car takes 1.5-2 hours through stunning mountain passes. Don't rush it - stop at viewpoints and Friday Market.</p>

                        <strong>Water is actually clear here</strong>
                        <p>Gulf of Oman is completely different from Dubai's murky Arabian Gulf. You can actually see fish. Bring snorkel gear.</p>

                        <strong>Snoopy Island is real</strong>
                        <p>The island really does look like Snoopy lying down. Snorkeling around it is the best in the UAE. Swim from Al Aqah beach.</p>

                    <div class="tip-item">
                        <strong>Rent a car, not a tour</strong>
                        <p>Public transport is very limited. A rental car gives you freedom to explore wadis, stop at viewpoints, and go at your own pace.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Why visit Fujairah instead of staying in Dubai?</summary>
                        <p>Fujairah offers clearer water on the Gulf of Oman (actual snorkeling/diving), dramatic Hajar Mountains, cooler breezes, and a nature-focused escape from Dubai's urban intensity. Many visitors combine city days in Dubai with 1-3 nights in Fujairah.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Fujairah good for beaches and snorkeling?</summary>
                        <p>Yes - it's the best in the UAE. Al Aqah, Khor Fakkan and Snoopy Island have clean sand, clear water and easy access to coral reefs. Dive centres offer trips for beginners and experienced divers.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can tourists drink alcohol in Fujairah?</summary>
                        <p>Yes - Fujairah is relaxed about alcohol. Non-Muslim visitors over 21 can drink in licensed hotel bars, restaurants and some shops without a personal licence. Public drinking is still illegal.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How many days do I need in Fujairah?</summary>
                        <p>1 day for a taster (fort, mosque, beach). 2-3 days for proper snorkeling/diving plus wadi exploring and relaxed evenings. Many Dubai residents come for weekends.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How do I get from Dubai to Fujairah?</summary>
                        <p>Drive or join a tour - 1.5-2 hours through scenic mountain passes. Intercity buses exist but a car gives flexibility to stop at viewpoints, Friday Market, and explore wadis. The drive itself is beautiful.</p>

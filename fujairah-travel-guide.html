            <!-- Why Visit Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Fujairah</h2>
                <p>Fujairah offers something genuinely rare in the UAE - untouched natural beauty. While the west coast emirates face the shallow, calm Arabian Gulf, Fujairah lies on the Gulf of Oman where the Indian Ocean brings deeper waters, coral reefs, and exceptional marine life. This geographic difference makes Fujairah the UAE's premier destination for diving and snorkeling, with visibility reaching 30 meters and reefs teeming with colorful fish, sea turtles, and even whale sharks seasonally.</p>

                <p>The dramatic Hajar Mountains plunge straight into the sea here, creating a landscape unlike anywhere else in the Emirates. Mountain wadis (valleys) carve through rust-colored peaks, forming natural swimming pools after rainfall. Drive through these wadis and you'll pass traditional villages where life moves at a pace forgotten elsewhere in the UAE. Al Bidyah Mosque, dating back 600 years, stands as the country's oldest, its simple mud-brick construction a humble contrast to the grand mosques of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Adventure enthusiasts will appreciate that Fujairah's Adventure Park was recently named World's Leading Adventure Tourist Attraction, offering mountain activities and outdoor experiences unique to the east coast.</p>

                <p>Fujairah's beaches remain blissfully undeveloped compared to the west coast. Sandy Bay and Snoopy Island offer pristine coastline where you're more likely to encounter local families than tourist crowds. The absence of mega-developments means hotel resorts actually feel like escapes rather than just upscale neighborhoods. Friday afternoons see Emirati families gathering for beach barbecues - join them and you'll experience genuine Arabian hospitality far from the commercialized tourism of Dubai. With significantly lower prices, cooler ocean breezes, and a fraction of the crowds, Fujairah rewards travelers seeking authenticity over Instagram moments.</p>

                <h2>Top Fujairah Experiences</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">Discover pristine beaches, mountain wadis, and authentic coastal experiences on UAE's east coast</p>

                <h3>1. Scuba Diving & Snoopy Island</h3>
                <p><strong>🤿 Diving: From AED 250+ | Snorkeling: Free-AED 100+ | Half/Full Day</strong></p>
                <p>Fujairah offers the UAE's premier underwater experiences. The Gulf of Oman's deeper waters host vibrant coral reefs, over 200 fish species, sea turtles, rays, and seasonal whale sharks. Snoopy Island (named for its profile resembling the cartoon dog) is the most accessible dive/snorkel site with crystal-clear waters reaching 30-meter visibility. Multiple dive operators offer PADI courses, guided dives, and snorkeling trips. The coast features numerous dive sites including wreck dives and drift dives along the Musandam fjords.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Best diving visibility October-May. Book diving packages (3-5 dives) for better rates. Snorkeling equipment can be rented from beach operators for AED 50-100. Early morning dives offer calmest conditions and best marine life encounters. Sea turtles are common at Snoopy Island year-round.</p>

                <h3>2. Al Aqah Beach & Sandy Bay</h3>
                <p><strong>⭐ Free Access | Half/Full Day</strong></p>
                <p>Al Aqah Beach stretches along the Gulf of Oman with golden sand, clear waters, and the dramatic Hajar Mountains as a backdrop - a view impossible on the west coast. Sandy Bay, just north, remains pristine and uncrowded compared to Dubai's packed beaches. The beach access is free, though some areas front luxury resorts. The calm, deeper waters are perfect for swimming year-round, and the beach remains blissfully free of jet ski noise and vendors that plague Dubai beaches.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Public beach access points are near Le Meridien Al Aqah and Sandy Beach resorts. Bring your own shade equipment as natural shade is limited. Weekend mornings see Emirati families gathering for beach barbecues - respectful visitors are often invited to share food. Water is noticeably clearer than the Arabian Gulf.</p>

                <h3>3. Wadi Wurayah National Park</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Entry (Permit Required) | Half Day Trip</strong></p>
                <p>The UAE's first designated mountain protected area covers 129 square kilometers of dramatic wadis, waterfalls, and natural pools. The wadi carves through rust-colored mountains, creating a landscape of rare beauty. Year-round natural springs feed waterfalls and swimming pools surrounded by lush vegetation - a shocking contrast to the desert. The reserve protects endangered Arabian tahr, foxes, and over 100 bird species. Hiking trails range from easy walks to challenging mountain treks.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Free permit required - apply online at least 2 days before visiting. 4WD vehicle essential for the access road. Bring swimwear for natural pools. Best after winter rains (December-March) when waterfalls are strongest. The wadi offers cool respite from beach heat - perfect for midday adventures. Hire local guides for best wildlife spotting.</p>

                <h3>4. Al Bidyah Mosque & Heritage Village</h3>
                <p><strong>⭐ Free Entry | 1 hour</strong></p>
                <p>The UAE's oldest mosque, dating back over 600 years, stands as a humble mud-brick structure with four distinctive domes supported by a single internal pillar. Its simple architecture contrasts sharply with the grand mosques of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, offering insight into pre-modern Islamic architecture. The adjacent heritage village preserves traditional houses, fort ruins, and watchtowers. Non-Muslims are welcome outside prayer times with respectful dress.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Located 40 minutes north of Fujairah city on the coastal road to Dibba. Visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid midday heat. The mosque interior is small but architecturally fascinating. Combine with nearby Friday Market and Snoopy Island for a full day. Free parking available. Modest dress required (covered shoulders, long pants/skirts, women should bring headscarf).</p>

                <h3>5. Fujairah Fort & Heritage Village</h3>
                <p><strong>Entry: AED 5 | Duration: 1-2 hours</strong></p>
                <p>Perched dramatically on a hill overlooking Fujairah city, this imposing fort dates back to the 16th century and served as the ruling family's residence and defensive stronghold. Recently restored, the fort features thick defensive walls, traditional architecture, and panoramic views of the modern city and mountains beyond. The adjacent heritage village recreates traditional Emirati life with exhibits on pearl diving, agriculture, and daily life in pre-oil times.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> At AED 5, it's excellent value. Visit in late afternoon for cooler temperatures and golden light for photography. The fort offers spectacular sunset views. Allow time to explore the heritage village below. The fort's hilltop position provides context for understanding Fujairah's strategic importance. Free parking at the base.</p>

                <h3>6. Friday Market (Open Daily Despite Name)</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Shopping | 1-3 hours</strong></p>
                <p>Despite its name, this market operates seven days a week selling traditional carpets, pottery, plants, and local produce. It's famous for hand-woven rugs from Iran and Afghanistan, copper pots, traditional khanjars (daggers), and local dates. The market atmosphere remains authentically local rather than tourist-oriented, with serious shoppers negotiating for quality carpets and household goods. Prices are significantly lower than Dubai souqs for comparable items.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Located on the Dibba road about 20km from Fujairah city. Mornings (7-11am) are most active. Bargaining is essential - start at 50% of asking price for carpets and metalwork. Quality varies greatly - examine items carefully. The plant section offers excellent prices on potted plants and date palms. Bring cash as many vendors don't accept cards.</p>

                <h3>7. Fujairah Museum</h3>
                <p><strong>Entry: AED 5 | Duration: 1-2 hours</strong></p>
                <p>This well-curated museum showcases Fujairah's history from Bronze Age archaeological sites to modern development. Exhibits include ancient pottery, weapons, traditional jewelry, pearl diving equipment, and displays about the Hajar Mountains' geological and cultural significance. The ethnographic section recreates traditional rooms showing pre-oil daily life. Recent expansion added interactive displays about east coast maritime history.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Located near Fujairah Fort - visit both together. The museum offers excellent air-conditioned respite during midday heat. Photography allowed in most areas. Audio guides available in multiple languages. The archaeological section features artifacts from nearby Bronze Age sites that aren't accessible to public. Free parking.</p>

                <h3>8. Dibba & Rock Pools</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Exploration | Half Day Trip</strong></p>
                <p>Dibba sits at Fujairah's northern tip where three borders meet (UAE Fujairah, UAE Sharjah, and Oman). The fishing village offers authentic coastal atmosphere with traditional dhows, fish markets, and uncrowded beaches. Natural rock pools along the coast create tide pools perfect for exploring marine life. The area serves as departure point for diving trips to the Musandam fjords. Beautiful mountain-meets-sea scenery surrounds the town.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> The drive north along the coast is spectacular. Dibba fish market (early morning best) offers ultra-fresh seafood. Rock pools are accessible at low tide - check tide schedules. Several simple beachfront restaurants serve excellent grilled fish. Dibba diving operators offer trips into Oman's Musandam Peninsula (passport required). Less developed than southern Fujairah - bring supplies.</p>

                <h3>9. Hajar Mountains Scenic Drives & Wadis</h3>
                <p><strong>Free Driving | Half/Full Day</strong></p>
                <p>The dramatic Hajar Mountains define Fujairah's character, plunging directly into the Gulf of Oman creating landscapes found nowhere else in the UAE. Multiple scenic drives wind through mountain passes with viewpoints overlooking terraced farms, traditional villages, and rust-colored peaks. Numerous wadis (valleys) offer hiking, natural pools, and authentic village encounters. The contrast between coastal heat and mountain coolness is remarkable.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Rent a 4WD for accessing mountain wadis. The Dibba coastal road offers spectacular mountain-sea views. Masafi village (between Fujairah and Dubai) is famous for bottled water and local crafts. Bring water, sun protection, and emergency supplies for mountain driving. Many wadis require walking/scrambling - wear appropriate footwear. Respect that mountain villages are working communities, not tourist attractions.</p>

                <h3>10. Ain Al Madhab Hot Springs</h3>
                <p><strong>Entry: AED 5 | Duration: 1-2 hours</strong></p>
                <p>Natural hot sulfur springs emerge from the mountains at constant 40°C temperature, creating mineral-rich bathing pools believed to have therapeutic properties. The facility includes separate sections for families and men, with natural stone pools where you can soak in mineral waters surrounded by mountain scenery. Popular with locals seeking relief from joint pain and skin conditions. The springs have been used for centuries by local communities.</p>
                <p><strong>Insider tip:</strong> Located inland near Masafi (45 minutes from Fujairah coast). Visit weekday mornings to avoid crowds. Bring towels and swimwear. The water has a sulfur smell that's stronger than commercial spa hot springs. Don't submerge your head as the mineral content can irritate eyes. The heat makes this better for cooler months (October-March). Combine with mountain wadi exploration for a full adventure day.</p>

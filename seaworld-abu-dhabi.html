                <p>SeaWorld Abu Dhabi opened in May 2023 and represents a completely new approach to marine life parks. Unlike traditional SeaWorld parks known for dolphin shows, this facility is a next-generation aquarium focused on education, research, marine rescue, and rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>The park is the world's largest indoor marine life theme park, spanning five floors and housing over 100,000 marine animals representing more than 150 species. The sheer scale is breathtaking - you're not just looking at tanks, you're walking through multi-level ocean habitats that recreate ecosystems from the Arctic to the Tropics.</p>

                <p>What makes SeaWorld Abu Dhabi truly special is its commitment to conservation. The facility includes one of the world's most advanced marine research centers and a rescue facility that rehabilitates injured or stranded marine animals before releasing them back to the ocean. When you visit, you're supporting these vital conservation efforts.</p>

                <p>Families, marine life enthusiasts, and anyone seeking an educational yet entertaining experience will find SeaWorld Abu Dhabi exceptional. The immersive environments, interactive exhibits, and hands-on encounters create memories that last a lifetime while fostering appreciation for ocean conservation.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are there dolphin or orca shows at SeaWorld Abu Dhabi?</h3>
                    <p>No. Unlike traditional SeaWorld parks, SeaWorld Abu Dhabi does not have dolphin or orca shows. The park focuses on education, conservation, and research rather than entertainment performances. There are educational presentations and feeding demonstrations, but no circus-style shows.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I touch or interact with the animals?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, there are supervised touch pools where you can touch rays and small sharks. Additional paid experiences allow closer interactions with sea lions and feeding opportunities. All interactions are designed with animal welfare as the priority.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is SeaWorld Abu Dhabi suitable for young children?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! Children of all ages will enjoy it. The penguin and otter exhibits are huge hits with toddlers. The park is stroller-friendly and has nursing rooms. However, very young children (under 3) may tire quickly from all the walking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does it compare to other aquariums worldwide?</h3>
                    <p>SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is among the world's largest and most modern marine life parks, comparable to Georgia Aquarium (USA), Okinawa Churaumi (Japan), and Oceanogràfic Valencia (Spain). The technology, animal care standards, and sheer scale are world-class.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I bring food and drinks inside?</h3>
                    <p>Outside food is generally not permitted except for baby food, formula, and special dietary requirements (with notice). Sealed water bottles are usually allowed. Free water fountains are available throughout.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is it worth the price?</h3>
                    <p>For marine life enthusiasts and families, yes. The scale, diversity of exhibits, and educational value justify the cost. If you're not particularly interested in marine life, you might find it expensive. Consider multi-park passes for better value.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between SeaWorld Abu Dhabi and Dubai Aquarium?</h3>
                    <p>SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is much larger (100,000+ animals vs 33,000), has more diverse ecosystems, and focuses on conservation. Dubai Aquarium is in a mall, smaller, but more centrally located. SeaWorld is a full-day experience; Dubai Aquarium is 1-2 hours.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to book animal encounters in advance?</h3>
                    <p>Highly recommended, especially on weekends and holidays. Popular experiences sell out quickly. Book at least 3-7 days ahead on the official website or inquire at your hotel concierge.</p>

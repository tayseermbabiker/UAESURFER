            <!-- Why Sharjah Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Sharjah</h2>
                <p>If you're asking "<strong>Sharjah vs Dubai - which is better for culture?</strong>" the answer is Sharjah, hands down. Named UNESCO's Cultural Capital of the Arab World, this emirate takes heritage seriously. Where Dubai builds taller and flashier, Sharjah invests in <strong>museums</strong>, heritage preservation, and authentic Emirati experiences. It's the perfect <strong>day trip from Dubai</strong> for culture-curious visitors.</p>

                <p>The contrast is immediate - cross the border and you'll notice the difference. <strong>Sharjah is a dry emirate</strong> (alcohol is banned everywhere), dress codes are stricter, and the pace is slower and more traditional. But this isn't a drawback - it's an authentic glimpse into Emirati values that's harder to find in cosmopolitan Dubai. The Heart of Sharjah transports you to pre-oil Arabia with restored coral stone houses, wind towers, and bustling souks.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Day trip tip:</strong> Most visitors do Sharjah as a half-day or full-day trip from Dubai. Morning: Heart of Sharjah + Museum of Islamic Civilization. Afternoon: Al Noor Island or Al Majaz Waterfront. Evening: Al Qasba for dinner and fountain show.

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How is Sharjah different from Dubai for tourists?</summary>
                        <p>Sharjah is more traditional and focused on culture, museums, and family life, with less nightlife and glitz than Dubai. It's ideal if you want heritage districts, museums and quieter waterfronts. You can still reach Dubai in under an hour for big-city experiences.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Sharjah really a "dry" emirate?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, Sharjah has a total ban on alcohol: no licensed bars or shops, and it's illegal to buy, possess, or drink alcohol anywhere in the emirate. Don't arrive drunk from Dubai or carry alcohol through - penalties can be strict.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is the dress code in Sharjah?</summary>
                        <p>Stricter than Dubai. Both men and women should cover shoulders and knees in all public places. Tight or transparent clothing is discouraged. Swimwear only at designated pools and beaches - don't walk around streets or malls in beachwear.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is Sharjah safe for tourists and families?</summary>
                        <p>Very safe, with low crime and a strong emphasis on families. The main risk isn't crime - it's accidentally ignoring conservative rules on dress and behaviour. Follow local customs and you'll have zero issues.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can I stay in Dubai and day trip to Sharjah?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely - most Western visitors do exactly this. Base yourself in Dubai and come to Sharjah for a half-day or full-day trip. By taxi it's 30-60 minutes depending on traffic. Avoid rush hours (7-9am, 5-8pm).</p>

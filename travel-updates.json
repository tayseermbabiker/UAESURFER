During Ramadan, eating, drinking, and smoking in public during daylight hours is prohibited by law — this applies to tourists as well. Restaurants in hotels and malls typically offer screened-off dining areas for non-fasting visitors. Many attractions adjust their hours, and nightlife slows down until iftar. After sunset, the UAE comes alive with night markets, special iftar buffets, and cultural events. Tourists are advised to dress more conservatively during this period and show respect for those who are fasting.","source_name":"WAM","category":"Legal","published_date":"2026-02-14"}]}

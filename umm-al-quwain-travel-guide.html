                <h2>Is Umm Al Quwain worth visiting?</h2>
                <p>Umm Al Quwain is worth visiting for a truly off-the-beaten-path UAE experience. It is the least touristy emirate, offering the Dreamland Aqua Park water park, excellent mangrove kayaking, a historic old town with traditional watchtowers, and some of the most affordable beachfront in the UAE. It is a 45-minute drive from Dubai and perfect for travellers who want to see the authentic, unhurried side of the country.</p>

            <!-- Why UAQ Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Why Visit Umm Al Quwain</h2>
                <p>If you're looking for a <strong>quiet emirate near Dubai for relaxing</strong>, UAQ is the answer. This is the UAE before the skyscrapers - shallow lagoons, pristine mangroves, flamingos, and a pace of life that Dubai forgot decades ago. It's not undeveloped; it's deliberately peaceful. The kind of place where <strong>camping and mangroves</strong> are the main attractions, not mega-malls.</p>

                <p>UAQ's khor (lagoon) system is perfect for kayaking, SUP, and kitesurfing in protected, calm waters. <strong>Dreamland Aqua Park</strong> has been a UAE family favourite since before Dubai's waterparks existed - it's nostalgic, fun, and significantly cheaper. The old town has genuine heritage without the restoration-for-tourists feel. This is where Dubai residents come to escape Dubai.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Escape tip:</strong> UAQ is ideal for a northern emirates loop: Dubai → Sharjah (culture) → Ajman (beach) → UAQ (nature) → back to Dubai. Or just come for sunrise kayaking and leave the city behind.
                </div>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Local Tip:</strong> The mangrove kayaking tours in Umm Al Quwain are a hidden gem. Book through Noukhada Adventure Company for guided sunrise tours. You will see flamingos, herons, and a completely different side of the UAE.

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Why visit Umm Al Quwain instead of Dubai?</summary>
                        <p>UAQ is the UAE's quietest emirate - pristine mangroves, calm lagoons, and an "old UAE" feel. Perfect if you want kayaking, kitesurfing, and camping in peaceful nature rather than malls and skyscrapers.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is UAQ good for kayaking and water sports?</summary>
                        <p>Excellent. The shallow lagoon system and mangroves are perfect for beginner-friendly kayaking, SUP, and kitesurfing in protected waters. Eco-tours focus on wildlife and quiet scenery.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can tourists drink alcohol in Umm Al Quwain?</summary>
                        <p>Yes - UAQ is relaxed about alcohol. Non-Muslim visitors over 21 can drink in licensed hotels, beach bars, and liquor stores without a personal licence. Public drinking is still illegal.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How many days do I need in UAQ?</summary>
                        <p>1 day for kayaking + waterpark or museum. 2 days adds beach time, camping, or island trips. Many visitors combine UAQ with a northern emirates loop (Ajman, Sharjah, RAK).</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How do I get from Dubai to Umm Al Quwain?</summary>
                        <p>Drive - 45-60 minutes from Dubai. Intercity buses exist but a car gives flexibility to reach mangroves, beaches, and inland areas. Public transport is very limited.</p>
